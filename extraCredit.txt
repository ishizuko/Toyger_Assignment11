Extra Credit - Data Quality Issue: Inconsistent Full Address Format

One of the issues in the dataset is that the "Full Address" column does not follow a consistent format.
While many entries follow the standard structure (Street, City, State, ZIP), others begin with a ZIP code or are missing commas.
These inconsistencies make it difficult to accurately extract structured address components such as city, state, and ZIP code.
